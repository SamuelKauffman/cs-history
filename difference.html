                    The Difference Engine was a digital calculating machine and was invented in the 1820's by Charles Babbage. It set itself apart from contemporary calculators by using memory storage just like a modern computer and it was designed to solve more complex problems. The Difference ultimately sparked a different interest with Babbage, who started thinking of ways to upgrade it, finally resulting in the idea of the Analytical Engine: a machine genereally considered as the first computer.

                <p>
                    The Difference Engine was a mechanical calculator - designed to tabulate polynomial functions by Charles Babbage in the 
                    19th century. It was designed to to calculate navigatory purposes since tables in use at the time were sometimes faulty and could set sailors off course; 
                    By automating the production of these tables, far more accurate numbers could be produced and less ships would be lost. 
                    The idea was well recieved by the British government and they would grant him funds to facillitate the project.
                    <br><br>Babbage himself was mathematician and is often considered the “father of computing” because of his 
                    Difference Engine and Analytical Engine designs. The Difference Engine was never completed in his lifetime due 
                    to technical difficulties fabricating the parts as well as an unwillingness from Joseph Clement, the actual manufacturer, 
                    to continue building witout pay since the British government could no longer financiate the project. A limited version based on Babbage’s design was built in 1989 
                    at the Science Museum in London.
