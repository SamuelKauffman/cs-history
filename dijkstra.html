                <p class="lead">Two of Dijkstra's significant contributions to computer science include: Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm for finding shortest path between nodes in a graph which was an early routing algorithm for the Internet and Semaphores, the concept to control access to shared resources in system (e.g. hard disk, printer, memory locations).

                <h3 class="display-6">Biography</h3>
                <p>Edsger Dijkstra was an early pioneer and giant figure in computer science. He was a theoretical physicist by training but he worked as a programmer early in his career at Mathematisch Centrum in Amsterdam in the 1950s.  He contributed to the discipline in numerous areas including: Compiler construction, Operating Systems, Concurrent Programming, Distribute Programming.
