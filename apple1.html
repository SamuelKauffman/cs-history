                <p>The Apple I hand-built by Steve Wozniak in 1975, kicked off the true era of personal computing.  The device had 1 Mhz MOS6502 processor, with 4KB of memory and a graphics card that supported 40 columns by 24 rows of characters. Steve Jobs, a friend of  Wozniak convinced him to sell the Apple I commercially. Together they formed Apple Computer Company in 1976. In total, they sold around 175 units between July 1976 and October 1977. In August 1977, the company started selling the Apple II an all-in-one device that many consider the true beginning of consumer appliance micro-computers.</p>
