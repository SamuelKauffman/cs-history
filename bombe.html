                <h3 class="display-6">Why Significant</h3>
                <p class="lead"><p>the significant of bombe machine in computer Science was that this machines's was not a computer. 
                    This was machine that helped codebreakers discover a part of ab Enigma key. 
                    it was the code Enigma code using the information that they decoded from the germans, 
                    the allies were able to prevent manyattacks.</p> 
                <h3 class="display-6">History</h3>
                <p> Lan Turking was the person invented the machine bombe and this machnine was an electromechanical code-breaking machine created by cryptologists in Britain during World War II to decode German messages that were encrypted using the Enigma machine. The Bombe was derived from a device called the bomba—Polish for “bomb”—that was invented in Poland during the 1930s.
                     Alan Turing developed the Bombe in 1939 at Bletchley Park, and the first Bombe machine was installed there in March 1940. 
                     Hundreds of Bombes were eventually built, including versions by the U.S. military. 
                    The Bombes were an important intelligence tool for the Allies, who used the machines to turn the tide of World War II against Nazi Germany.
                    The Germans, however, continued to make changes to Enigma, and Rejewski responded with a solution that would have far-reaching, and lasting, 
                    effects: he transformed the catalog that he and his team had compiled into a mechanical system—a machine—that could quickly find a match 
                    amid all 17,576 scrambler settings.  

                    This machine was also important because  heralded the industrialisation of codebreaking, 
                    and the intelligence they provided was crucial to Allied success in WW2.It was the task of the Bombe to discover the daily key - wheel order, wheel settings and plugboard configuration - to enable the 3-5,000 Enigma messages intercepted each day to be deciphered. Some keys would be broken within 2-4 hours, 
                    some would never be broken speed was always of the essence. So this was the importance of the machine Bombe.
