                <p class="lead">Tim Berners-Lee is credited with inventing the World Wide Web (not the Internet!) while working at CERN, 
                    the particle physics laboratory in Switzerland in the late 80s and early 90s.  He designed and built the first web browser 
                    and web server to serve technical documents to members of CERN.   In 1994, Berners-Lee founded the W3C, the standards organization 
                    for HTML that develops and maintains the official HTML standard.

                <h3 class="display-6">Biography</h3>
                <p>Timothy John Berners-Lee was born in London on 8 June 1955, A keen trainspotter as a child, he learnt about electronics from tinkering with a model railway.
                    From 1973 to 1976, he studied at The Queen's College, Oxford, where he received a first-class BA in physics. While there, he made a computer out of an old television set he had purchased from a repair shop.
                    After graduation, Berners-Lee worked as an engineer at the telecommunications company Plessey in Poole, Dorset. In 1978, he joined D. G. Nash in Ferndown, Dorset, where he helped create typesetting software for printers.
                    Berners-Lee worked as an independent contractor at CERN from June to December 1980. While in Geneva, he proposed a project based on the concept of hypertext, to facilitate sharing and updating information among researchers.
                    To demonstrate it, he built a prototype system named ENQUIRE. in 1990, Berners-Lee along with Robert caillou proposed a project to develop a hypertext system at CERN, and joined Berners-Lee as a partner in his efforts to get the web off the ground.
                    They used similar ideas to those underlying the ENQUIRE system to create the World Wide Web, for which Berners-Lee designed and built the first web browser.
