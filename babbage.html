                <h3 class="display-6">Significant Contribution</h3>
                <p class="lead"> Charles Babbage is widely recognized for his contributions to computer science during the 1800s. 
                    He is particularly famous for designing two early-age computers: the difference engine and the analytical engine. 
                    Unfortunately, however, due to insufficient funds, Babbage's plans for these machines were never fully realized. 
                    Although he almost completed the difference engine, Babbage needed more funding to finalize the device and had to stop building. 
                    After his failed venture involving the difference engine, Babbage later attempted to construct the analytical engine but was unsuccessful
                     due to more funding issues. Though the difference and analytical engines were not completed, 
                     Babbage's visionary contributions inspired many.

                <h3 class="display-6">Biography</h3>
                <p> Charles Babbage was born to Benjamin Babbage and Betsy Plumleigh Babbage on December 26th, 1791.
                     From a considerably young age, Babbage displayed a great degree of intelligence, going so far as 
                     teaching himself algebra concepts with no outside assistance. Babbage attended Trinity College at 
                     Cambridge as an early adult in 1811. Babbage would end up teaching mathematics there himself. 
                     Five years later, Babbage became part of the Royal Astronomical Society in 1816, and four years after 
                     that, Babbage started work on his two computers: the difference engine and analytical engine. 
                     While Babbage's efforts to build these two machines would last several decades, Babbage was busy
                      with other occupations. Babbage served as the chair of mathematics at Cambridge from 1828 to 1839. 
                      Babbage also worked in the establishment of the Association for the Advancement of Science and the Royal 
                      Statistical Society. Babbage later passed away on October 18th, 1871.
