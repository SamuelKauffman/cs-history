                <p><strong>Dates: </strong>Created in 2800 BCE and is still in use today</p>
                <h3 class="display-6">Why Significant</h3>
                <p class="lead">Since written numbers had not been invented yet the abacus was the solution. It allowed people to add and subtract large numbers that they couldn't do in their head. Not only can the abacus add and subtract but it can also do multiplication, division,square roots, and fractions.</p>
                <h3 class="display-6">History</h3>
                <p>As the abacus has its roots as far back as Mesopotamian civilization, it's difficult to attribute a single person as the inventor of this counting frame.
                    It was originally used for counting items as there was no written number system. 
                    It is still used today for teaching children simple mathematics and especially multiplication.
                    It is also used in a simpler wayas a scoring system in non eletronic table games.
