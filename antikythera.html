                <h3 class="display-6">The Antikythera Mechanism is a mechanical computer that could predict the solar and lunar motions and thier eclipses. </h3>
                <p class="lead">The Antikythera Mechanism is significant to computation because it's considered to be the oldest example of an analog computer. It's a device that can perform calculations based on a set of rules or algorithms. 
                    </p>
                <h3 class="display-6">From Greek, the Antikythera Mechanism is a hand-powered orrery and is used to predict astronomical positions and exlipses decaded in advance. It was discovered in 1900-1901. By 1902 it was identified as an astronomical device, and it continued to be further analyzed 1971-1976.</h3>
                <p>It is still in speculation of who exactly built the Antikythera Mechanism but it was discovered by Captain Dimitrios Kontos and a crew of sponge divers. There are some people in theory who may have built the machine such as invento and mathmatician Archmedes who lived in the 3rd century BC. Hipparchus of Rhodes is another possible candidate for the invention of the Antikythera Mechanism.  The Antikythera Mechanism is known to be an ancient device and the original computer used to calculate and display astronomical information and predict the solary systems movements. No one is sure who used the Mechanism but many of it's functions have been figured out but how and where it was used are still unknown.
