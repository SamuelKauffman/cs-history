                    Spärck Jones used her research in an attempt to get machines to understand human language.
                     She was inspired by natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval. 
                     Continuing with this path, by 1970, she created the concepts of inverse document frequency (IDF) and index-term weighting. 
                     These discoveries are the principles behind modern search engines. 
                     In her honor, the Karen Spärck Jones Award was released in 2008. This is awarded for outstanding research in information retrieval (IR) and natural language processing (NLP).

                <h3 class="display-6">Biography</h3>
                <p>
                    During World War II, Spärck Jones' mother fled to England and Spärck Jones was born in Huddersfield, UK.
Before her work in computer science, she received a history degree at Cambridge's Girton College 
                    and briefly worked as a school teacher. 
                    Until she married Roger Needham in 1958. Then, she became intrigued with his work in computer science and joined the field. 
                    She found her first research position at Cambridge Language Research Unit and, beginning in 1999, she became a professor of computers.
