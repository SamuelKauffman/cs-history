                <p>Grace Hopper was an early computer scientist who worked on the Harvard Mark I computer at end of World War II.   She had a Ph.D. in Mathematics and was an officer in the Navy from which she retired in 1985 as Rear Admiral.  She was instrumental in developing the first linker/compiler and she developed a programming language called FlowMatic which was used as a prototype for COBOL, one of the first widely available high level programming languages in the computer industry. The impact of COBOL cannot be understated; it is still used on many large banking and financial system to this day.  The largest computer science conference in the world featuring only female speakers is name after Hopper.
