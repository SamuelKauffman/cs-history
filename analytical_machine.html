                <p class="lead">Intended as a general symbol manipulator, the Analytical Engine was a flexible and powerful punched-card-controlled calculator, embodying many features which later reappeared in the modern stored-program computer.</p>
                <h3 class="display-6">History</h3>
                <p>The Analytical Engine was another machine envisioned by Babbage in the 19th century. He intended it to be a general-purpose computing device.  The device incorporated an arithmetic logic unit, control flow, conditional branching and loops â€“ basically most of the functions of a modern computer. It was also designed to use punched cards for input. The machine was never completed because of funding, but it significantly influenced the computer designs in the 20th century.
