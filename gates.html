                <h3 class="display-6">Significant Contribution</h3>
                <p class="lead">Bill Gates and Paul Allen started Micro-Soft in 1975 to sell their BASIC software for the Altair 8800. In the early 1980s, they bought CPM/DOS and licensed it to IBM for all IBM desktop computers.  From that deal Microsoft grew into a billion dollar company.  Today it develops many widely used applications such as the Windows family of Operating Systems, Office, Teams, SQL Server and many other products. 
Gates stepped down as Chairman of Microsoft in 2014 and currently pursues philanthropy full-time through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

                <h3 class="display-6">Biography</h3>
                <p>Bill Gates was born in Seattle, Washington in 1955. He wrote his first software program at the age of 13. In high school, he formed a group of programmers who computerized their school's payroll system.
                He attended Harvard University. In 1975, Gates' sophomore year, joined Paul Allen to develop a software for the first microcomputers. They adapted BASIC for microcomputer use. Their success led Gates to leave Harvard in his junior year and, with Allen, create Microsoft. They deveoped an operating system called MS-DOS and licensed it to IBM. By the start of the 1990s the PC industry became dependant on Microsoft operating sytems.
